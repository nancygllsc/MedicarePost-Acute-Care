# MedicarePost-Acute-Care
The Medicare Post-Acute Care and Hospice Provider Utilization and Payment Public Use Files (PAC PUF) provide detailed information on the demographic and clinical characteristics of beneficiaries, as well as professional and paraprofessional service utilization and payment data. This information is available at the provider, state, and national levels for each PAC setting (e.g., Home Health Agencies, hospices, Skilled Nursing Facilities, Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities, and Long-Term Care Hospitals). Additional datasets, including details on unique variables such as case-mix groups for HHAs, SNFs, and IRFs, are available for download under the 'Resources' section.

Please note that the data provided may not fully represent a physicianâ€™s entire practice. Additionally, the information does not reflect the quality of care and is not risk-adjusted for differences in the severity of patient populations.
